dreams of becoming a data scientist Keep watching this video if you passionate about designs because we will tell you how does it really work on the Health Sciences let's see how a day in a life goes why she is working on the science project well it is very important to understand the business broken first in a meeting with X Mr ask relevant questions understand and define subjective the problems that need to be tattoo she is it is sold to ask a lot of right one of the many traits of a good day to find it now you get up for data acquisition to scrape data from multiple sources like web service logs databases API is online depository it seems like finding the right data for exports time and effort has gathered complete your preparation the step involved direct cleaning and the transformation cleaning is the most time consuming wall hanging many Complex scenarios remedies with inconsistent datatypes list builders bute missing values duplicate values and what not then interior transformation shift modify the data based on defined map and rules in a project etail to slide talent and Informatica I used to perform Complex transformations that helps the team to understand the data structure better understanding what you can do with your data is very crucial for that Mr does exploratory data analysis with help of define and define selection of variables that will be used in the morning but what is EMIS get that she might end up using the wrong materials which will produce and inaccurate model does exploratory data analysis become the most important step now we proceed to the core activity of a data science project is just data modelling she is repeatedly applies adverse machine Canon decision tree nice days to the data to identify the model that best fits the business requirement ship train from models on the training data set and test them to select the best performing Mori Amma preface writing for modelling the data however it can also be done using for that well the trickiest part is not get over visualisation and communication among the clients again to communicate with business findings in a simple and effective manner to convince to take holder uses tools and tableau power and qlikview that can help in creating powerful reports and dashboards can find any two deploys and maintains the morning it was selected model in a production environment before applying it in the production environment which is the best practice right after successfully deploying acchi uses reports and dashboards to get a real time analytics for the also the product performance well that how am I completed science project you have seen the daily routine of a data scientist with Akola fun has a lot of interesting aspects and comes with isko share challenges now let's see how did science is changing the world designs techniques with all with genomic data provide 81 understanding of genetic issues and reaction to particular drugs and diseases love the companies like the actual FedEx discover the best route to shift the best time to deliver the best mode of transport to choose that leading to cost efficiency with designs it is possible to not only project employee attrition but you also understand the ki variables that influence employee turnover also the airline companies can easily protect slightly and notify the passengers before hand to enhance that travel experience well if you're wondering the various roles of a scientist like data analyst machine learning engineer deep learning engineer data engineer and scientist comedian pay salaries of a data scientist in range from $95,000 21 $65,000 to that was about the designs Ayurvedic to be a data scientist if yes then start with the word of data in nature that help from my side today thank you for watching comment below the next topic that you want to learn and subscribe to simply learn to get the latest updates on most interesting videos thank you and reasoning
